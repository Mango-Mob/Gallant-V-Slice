Fetus font explanations
---
USE INTER FOR NUMERICALS
---
MENU FONTS
---
I desire something clean, with sharp edges. Preferably sans serif as well, since I want to use serif for dialogue. 

Qanelas Soft - rounded font, suitable for most things

---
TOOLTIP FONTS (GW2 actually use two fonts for their tooltips, the header is slightly different from the main body)
---
Inter - wow I'm in love.

Open Sans - clean, has many weights to choose from. Kerning is a bit too wide for my tastes, however.

Qanelas Soft - rounded font, suitable for most things

---
BOOK / DIALOGUE FONTS
---
Bespoke Serif - really nice for long bodies of text. The numericals look strange if they're squished next to letters, however.
