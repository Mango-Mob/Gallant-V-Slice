  descriptions:
  - "It has been three days since I first entered Longing\u2019s domain. Unfortunately,
    I have not made much progress. It seems as though the environment here is situated
    in a loop. Yesterday, in an attempt to locate a way to leave this godforsaken
    place, I realised I had passed through the tree I had marked when I first arrived
    here thrice. Perhaps I must take up arms after all\u2026"
  - 'Success! After defeating those miscreants, a staircase appeared. I am unaware
    if it will lead to the exit (highly unlikely, the reports belonging to the missing
    researchers noted signs of sadistic tendencies from Longing during her visits
    in the Overworld), however, for the sake of knowledge, I will proceed further. '
  - "The journey has only grown more difficult since my last entry. The food here
    is scarce, barely fit for consumption, and the water\u2026 It can barely be classified
    as such. If I were an Inkman, I would not have to suffer so\u2026 Alas...\r\n"
  - "It is getting very difficult, holding my pen. I do not have much strength left.
    I believe I have progressed through four levels. \r\n\r\nSometimes I can hear
    her whisper to me in my sleep and (illegible text, bloodstains on page)\r\n\r\n(Strangely,
    the colour of the page fades to white at the bottom. The words \u2018Hello Inkman\u2019
    are scrawled on the bottom right corner in black ink)\r\n"
