  description: "It has been three days since I first entered Longing\u2019s domain.
    Unfortunately, I have not made much progress. It seems as though the environment
    here is situated in a loop. Yesterday, in an attempt to locate a way to leave
    this godforsaken place, I realised I had passed through the tree I had marked
    when I first arrived here thrice. Perhaps I must take up arms after all\u2026"
