  descriptions:
  - "This is probably the third Aspect I\u2019ve made so far; my memory is rather
    fuzzy. Alas, I have no recordings of prior days.        has given me a helping
    hand in creating this one, you can tell because of her colouration. I doubt she
    has enough of him in her to classify as a Grey One, but who knows?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll
    name her Longing for now. \r"
  - "Longing has seen the other Aspects frolicking about, and demands a playmate
    of her own. When I told        that, he laughed, and said, \u201CI wonder where
    she got that from!\u201D\r\n\r\nFunny. Once he\u2019s done enjoying himself,
    I\u2019ll ask him to think of a solution.\r\n"
  - "Well, he\u2019s made something. He calls his creation Drive, yet the Aspect
    resembles anything but. The little spit is incredibly awkward and timid; anybody
    would mistake Drive as one of my own. Perhaps        forgot a step or two while
    creating Drive, he tends to do that. \r\n\r\nAt least Longing doesn\u2019t seem
    to mind, right now she\u2019s prodding Drive with the blunt side of her tail.\r\n"
  - "It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve logged an entry. It reminds me of my
    earthbound days, where I\u2019d spend a few hours every day logging events. \r\n\r\nAnyway,
    the first batch of Aspects we\u2019ve created has now been assigned to their
    reality pockets.        and I will monitor them closely, reprimand any transgressions,
    and continue to guide them from a distance. Longing and Drive will remain with
    us, they have not fully matured yet. \r\n"
  - "Drive is\u2026interesting. He might be       \u2018s most nuanced Aspect yet.
    Drive\u2019s meek disposition dissolves whenever I discuss with him various moral
    dilemmas I\u2019ve designed. There's a focused, dare I say, driven look in his
    eyes that reminds me of        whenever a significant issue demands his attention.  
    \r\n\r\nI asked Drive why he behaves differently in front of me. He told me he\u2019s
    more comfortable around my presence and doesn\u2019t appreciate how his father
    (hearing any Aspect refer to us with parental terms still strikes me as rather
    odd) never finishes any project he rambles on about. Then I questioned him about
    Longing. He said Longing prefers it when he\u2019s subservient, and because he
    was created to accompany Longing, he felt obligated to continue this fa\xE7ade.
    \r\n"
