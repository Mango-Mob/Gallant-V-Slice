  descriptions:
  - "The two inkmen rowed the boat. Each stroke of their paddle shattered the reflection
    that glimmered on the ocean waves. Quail had never seen the sea this calm before.
    Perhaps the fisherman was telling the truth after all?\r\n\r\n\u201CQuail!\u201D
    Lark let go of his paddle and rummaged through his knapsack. \u201CI think I
    forgot the ham sandwiches.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe rolled her eyes and stopped rowing.
    \u201CTime?\u201D\r\n\r\nLark checked his pocket watch. \u201CTwenty-three minutes.\u201D\r\n\r\nShould
    the Two grant it, Lark and Quail would witness a phenomenon no Searcher had documented
    before\u2014the question was when. The recount the fisherman provided to the
    Searchers was so fanciful; Quail suspected the man was off his rocker. He was
    harping about some vision he\u2019d seen from a drunken stupor (most fishermen
    in Saywhere were alcoholics to stave off the constant chill). Lark gently reminded
    her that their job as Searchers was to confirm and record unusual happenings.
    The Aspect that ruled this world, Spontaneity, had a knack for making the Searchers
    here sweat. Stupid Aspects. Stupid Two.\r\n\r\n\u201CStinking dead-end job.\u201D
    \r\n\r\n\u201CWhat did you say?\u201D\r\n\r\nQuail set her eyes on the horizon.\r\n"
