  descriptions:
  - "There are several creation myths, but the Aspects tell a different tale of how
    these worlds came to be. \r\n\r\nWhilst it would be preferable if one of the
    Firsts would heed my requests and simply confirm these claims, the words of the
    others shall do.\r\n\r\nThey say the Two sailed from a land far away, searching
    for a quiet refuge.        and       discovered a barren plateau. The soil was
    bone white, the rocks an ashen grey, the perfect canvas. They decided this island
    would become their home. \r\n\r\nFirst,      pierced her skull, and used the
    fluid to etch the law onto the land.        split his heart into different threads,
    each strand a brilliant colour, and weaved himself into his surroundings. Vegetation
    flourished, animals thrived, and life bloomed on this strange, once empty isle.\r\n\r\nFor
    a while, the Two settled into their new home and enjoyed each other's company
    in their own paradise.       , however, quickly grew bored, and asked if      
    could create a child. She accepted his request.\r\n\r\nThus, the first Aspect
    was born\u2014Anarchy. Eldest of the H\u0101kshiro, the Black Aspects, she encapsulated
    what       feared the most.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable time had passed, System,
    Anarchy\u2019s brother, was made. Leader of the B\u0101kkuro, the White Aspects,
    he was what        desired, a stable, sustainable relationship with his partner.\r\n\r\nThe
    Two knew conflict lay ahead in their children\u2019s future, but for now, tried
    to teach them how to co-exist. Once the Aspects were mentally mature, the Two
    dug deep underground and created two worlds for Anarchy and System. Each Aspect
    would govern over their own space, and was incentivised to keep their inhabitants
    alive; reality pockets were rather difficult to create.\r\n"
