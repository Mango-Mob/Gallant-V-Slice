  - "I don't regret flaunting the fact I'm Father and Mother\u2019s favourite, but
    I wish Inquisitive would stop trying to figure out what they've told me. For
    goodness sake, it's in her name; I know what she's up to.\r\n\r\nWhy am I writing
    you this, rather than speaking to you than I normally do? Well, sometimes it's
    easier to pen your thoughts down, rather than crystalise them into words. Funny
    though, because I always do both for you, my dear reader.\r\n"
